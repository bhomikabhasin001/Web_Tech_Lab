    <p>Mountains are heaven.</p>
    <p>They are large natural elevations of the Earth's surface,
        usually rising sharply above the surrounding land.
        They are formed by geological processes like 
        tectonic plate movements and volcanic activity.
        Mountains are home to unique ecosystems and provide water,
        minerals, and recreational opportunities.
